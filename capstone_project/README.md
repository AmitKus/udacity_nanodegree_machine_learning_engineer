# Capstone Project

This capstone project was done as a requirement for Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program on Udacity.

Here are the links to different documents:

## Code details:

1. [capstone_project_part1](https://github.com/AmitKus/udacity_nanodegree_machine_learning_engineer/blob/master/capstone_project/code/capstone_project_part1.ipynb): This notebook has code to load the data, perform summary statistics and do visual exploration.
2. [capstone_project_part2](https://github.com/AmitKus/udacity_nanodegree_machine_learning_engineer/blob/master/capstone_project/code/capstone_project_part2.ipynb): This notebook defines the probability models in PyMC3 and fit/save all the models.
3. [capstone_project_part3](https://github.com/AmitKus/udacity_nanodegree_machine_learning_engineer/blob/master/capstone_project/code/capstone_project_part1.ipynb): This notebook performs the model evaluation based on the defined metrics and ranks the models. It also plots the posterior distributions of the parameters for the best model.

There is requirements.txt file which gives the details of the packages.
