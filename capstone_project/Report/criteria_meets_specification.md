## Data Preprocessing

The data does not have any missing or unphysical values. For modeling purposes, the age column (feature vector) was standardize. Standardization typically means rescaling data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (unit variance). THe formula for standardization is:

$ X' = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$


## Implementation

The following polynomial models were fitted to the data using the probabilisic programming package PyMC3.

$$
\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\begin{split}
\cal{M}_p: h_i &\approx \text{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
 \mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 x_i^2 ..... + \beta_p x_i^p
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$ 

### Evaluation metrics: Information Criteria

A good model is one that 



We will compare different models based on their WAIC scores(Watanabeâ€“Akaike information criterion). We will rank the model based on their WAIC score and the model with lowest WAIC score is our best model.

**Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC):** It does not require a multivariate Gaussian posterior, and it is often more accurate than DIC. The distinguishing feature of WAIC is that it is pointwise. It access flexibility of a model with respect to fitting each observation, and then sumps up across all observations.

$WAIC = -2 (\sum_{i=1}^N \log Pr(y_i) - \sum_{i=1}^N V(y_i))$

Where $V(y_i)$ is the variance in the log-likelihood for observation $i$ in the training sample.

$p(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 \pi \sigma^2 }} e^{ - \frac{ (x - \mu)^2 } {2 \sigma^2} }$

$log(p(x)) = -0.5*log{2 \pi \sigma^2} - \frac{ (x - \mu)^2 } {2 \sigma^2}$

From WAIC definition (compute for each $y_i$ or weigth data):

$\log Pr(y_i) = -0.5*log{2 \pi \sigma^2} - \frac{ (y_i - \mu_i)^2 } {2 \sigma^2}$

Refinement

The process of improving upon the algorithms and techniques used is clearly documented. Both the initial and final solutions are reported, along with intermediate solutions, if necessary.
